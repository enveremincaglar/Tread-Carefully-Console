# TreadCarefullyGame

## Overview

TreadCarefullyGame is a simple console-based game where players must guess numbers generated randomly by the program. The objective is to avoid matching any of the randomly generated numbers with the player's guesses. If any guesses match, the player loses the game.
+ In the plus version of the game, you will encounter a different gameplay. A board will appear in front of you, and you will step on the mines one by one. If you step on the wrong mine, the game ends. Have fun!

## Note

Additionally, I could have written the program with more methods; yes, they are right. However, I didn't want to make it too complex. Plus, I was a bit lazy. I hope it helps someone. Enjoy the game!

You can see two different types of boards; there are logical differences between the two, and the awareness I needed to create these differences was provided by ChatGPT. Thank you, ChatGPT!
